The complete package containing all #{PACKAGES.length} very useful functions. These functions are bound by these principles:

You can use each of these packages individually:

``` javascript
import {hammer} from "@unction/complete"
```

A set of  function.

  - All functions will have type annotations (and be automatically checked for their type safety).
  - All functions will only take a single argument (via currying).
  - All inner functions will be named based on the outer function and it's argument name, to improve debugging readability.
  - Functions that deal with types will a common standard format (see: `type()`)
  - Functions that mutate the original value, though rare, will have a suffix of M.
  - Functions that take or return promises will have a suffix of P.
  - Functions that can work on one type of Functor (value that can be mapped) can work on another type, including:
    - List (Array, Set)
    - Record (Object, Map)
    - Text (String, Buffer)
    - Stream (xstream)
