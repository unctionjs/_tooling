# unctionjs tooling

This is a list of all the tools available for managing all unctionjs packages. There are two types of repository:

  - Metapackage, which are random things like the type repository and this repository
  - Package, which is a npm package

The only repository that blurs the line is `_tempLate`, which is a metapackage that we also want to maintain the same way.
